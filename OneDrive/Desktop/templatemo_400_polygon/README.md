## FAQ

#### Why did you build this project? 

Answer To show our Skill on Photography




## Description
 # Home Section - page to the photographer or picture studio is found here. It features a slideshow of images taken by the photographer, all of which are arranged in a conscientious manner. Each image provides a small amount of information regarding the genre of photography in which it was taken. The smooth scroll feature allows the user to smoothly scroll down through different parts by clicking on buttons in the navbar, which accomplishes the same thing. When the user clicks on a button, a modest animation and a scroll to the top option are both presented.
 
 # Album Section - To show off the photographer's work, this section is dubbed the "Album Section." An image carousel is used to handle numerous rows of photographs of varying heights. When a user hovers over a photo in the image carousel, the name of the photo is displayed.

 # Contact Section area can be used to get in touch with the photographer by filling out a simple form or by using the social media links provided below.
